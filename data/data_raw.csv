9,"I am curious for comparison because I have had only two boyfriends and it's been super different!

My first boyfriend was long distance (\~7hr drive) and we would text every day probably..... once per hour? Usually just interesting/ funny things that we saw or experienced (on the internet or in real life) as opposed to a real conversation. Then before bed we would have a ""How was your day?"" conversation for two or three hours. It helped us feel close when we were far from each other.

My current boyfriend and I work together and we'll frequently go a day with zero texts. When we do text it's 90% of the time to make plans. We usually are able to do the ""How have the last few days been?"" conversation in person.

This leads to males in adulthood have very weak bonds with each other (because they feel like their male friends 'don't care' about their Bros) Those men who have strong connection with their friends while in adulthood have better physically, mental and emotional health while also avoiding substance abuse and alcoholism.

She's good in every aspect and I really can't find one bad thing to say about her. My problem is with my lizard brain, that gets turned on every time I go out with some friends into some bar or any other event where lots of ladies will be present. I get that impulse that takes hold of me and then I want to flirt, I start thinking this one looks really pretty, I wonder what it would be to fuck with this one, and I feel like shit because I realize that I want to be single again.

I have been for most of my life single, until 28 to be exact.

 She is a lil better now but wants to keep on absorbing my time and have my full attention which I cannot keep on giving since I recently changed jobs, have been in an up-and-down mood and also I'm an introvert working in an environment that makes me interact with lots of people and it's totally exhausting (Note: this is not a complaint, I do love my new job).

At 215 pounds,  There was a kid who stood out like a sore thumb from the rest. He already had cauliflower ear  And had a head like a fucking toaster. He was 1st on the scale at his weight and was .3 pounds over. His coach ask him if he can piss, Gave him gum and told him to start spitting and put him on a bicycle. You only have until the end of your weight class to make weight and so the guy only had a few minutes to lose .3 pounds.  Meanwhile his coach is whispering in a teammate's ear and calls the big kid back over. As he walks up his teammate rares back and strokes this kid in the nose and blood went everywhere.

So i asked out my work friends' sister (who also works with us but i rarely saw her as we work different days/hours) out 2 days ago but we are both in school i just finished my last midterm but she has both her midterms this week + work so we decided to go on our date this Monday coming up.  We were kinda friends, me mainly with her brother and i would see her here and there.  

About a month ago, after hanging out in a party and us getting more personal, i decided to start talking to her more by snapchat.  Then 2 days ago i decided to  ask her out and she said yes.  After the whole planning, we both agreed on Monday but what i'm seeing is that she does sound very exited for the date, but she rarely texts me first (even when we were just talking here and there she rarely texted me first) , i know she is probably busy studying for her midterms at the moment, i usually start the conversation and she always replies and what not but i don't know what to think.  

Should i be texting her often to show interest? or should i back off a little and just text when it gets closer to our date?  I don't know how to act since i've never gone out with a person that i'm already kind of friends with.

I feel like lately it's become a problem, though. We went out for dinner on my birthday with a couple friends and she kept teasing our server and giving what I felt were flirty looks. She convinced him to give us a free sake bomb. I tried not to be bothered but I felt as though she was flirting with him from right across from me and it made me feel devalued. I bought it up later and she said she wasn't trying to flirt. 

The problem is that she gets ""free stuff"" and things done for her in all areas of her life. There's a guy in her class that asked for her Instagram, but she responded with saying she had a boyfriend. I later found out that the same guy was doing her homework for her in another class, sharing his assignments with her, etc. When I bought this up she'd go on to say he's just a nice guy, that guys wouldn't care to be into her while she has a boyfriend, etc.

Even going back to the first night we met, I kissed her at a party. We started to go on dates after that and I felt clear with my intentions but she had no idea I had feelings for her.

I‚Äôve been so ignorant in lacking a depth of true understanding about the struggle for men to feel or even be vulnerable and show emotions in a society that humiliates and ridicules them for it.

If you have gone to meetup for a while, at least in larger cities, you find that there are these [age bracket], singles, professionals, or mixer type of meetups that are usually combined groups from like 6+ meetup groups and maybe more.  They end up with like 50 to 150 gathered up.  

I've been to very few over several years as I usually went to board games, hiking, and things like that.

It would be nice to meet more potential friends or dates and at first, these huge gatherings seemed nice for that.

It just seems like one meetup, doesnt feel like it's enough to get to know someone.  Those meetups aren't that very regular it seems and very unlikely to see the same person.

Am I being naive and silly like my friends and family claim? Or can this progress into something stable and durable? My mom is probably the most critical about the situation. She says that at such a young age, M will undergo drastic changes in personality and preferences that she will be unrecognizable 10 years from now, and then we will split. What do you guys think?

471,"In Coach Carter, Samuel L. Jackson makes his players run 1000 suicides (I think multiple times). A suicide takes roughly 30 seconds when going at a full sprint (you essentially run the length of the basketball court 5 times). So he is making his players run for 500 minutes, or 8+ hours, if they can sprint the entire time and don't take any breaks. I assume whoever wrote that scene had never actually run a one(or the studio just cared more about the number than reality).

474,"Preface with I've just had surgery and am waiting for the greenlight to begin lifting at my gym w/ a personal trainer. 

Also recently divorced. 

So men, I have been thinking about exploring the night life more often in my city of Orlando but one thing stops me from experiencing it alone everytime and that is my personal safety. 

I am worried about going to a strip club alone and having a good time and when I go to leave I'm possibly mugged in the parking lot. Or going to a popular night club and while shooting my shot possibly getting into a demasculating confrontation with another man. I have had the displeasure (or pleasure?) Of never being in a fight and feel insecure about this. 

I'm not muscular, just average with a few pounds. 

I was thinking of signing up for a boxing class package to get over the fear of getting hit and building myself up at the gym to promote my outer appearance and get that testosterone/endorphin release to boast my confidence. Is there anything else you guys can suggest? 

Am 22. Was in the military (pog) which explains why I married young.",AskMen
475,"So I keep getting told that I have intimidating facial features, I'm tall, and fit. I am not socially inept and I have plenty of friends, but pretty much all of my friends have admitted to me that when we first met they were terrified of me. Sometimes at parties I'll intentionally play up how scary I look by dressing like agent 47 (I have a pretty similar appearance actually), but most of the time I really don't want to be seen as scary. I try to keep from making sudden movements when around girls and short friends as I seem to easily intimidate them. It isn't so bad I guess as I haven't had anyone fuck with me in public in years, but it gets pretty lonely sometimes when most people are visibly intimidated by you.  I mostly like to hang out with other tall dudes and have a preference for tall girls because they seem to be at ease the most around me. I am also not a violent person so I don't actively try to fight anyone so people wouldn't be intimidated because of that.",AskMen
478,"Men who get more attention from other males than females, are comments/views desirable or something you'd prefer not to get at all?

For the attention, is it directed at you more subtly/kind or direct/overt?  Do you have a preference between the two?


I guess I have a second question (which sounds loaded) regarding being desired. I tend to keep to myself and I think/feel some guys pick up on me (my greenish-gray eyes give my pupils away) finding them attractive, typically other quiet guys. I do think they know and don't mind (I never glance at them, with them facing me), given I'm quiet/listening most of the time but I can't quite pick up if I've convinced myself they come to talk to me because of it or if it's purely happenstance.

For me, I just want to have a meaningful job that pays okay and a lot of time to relax and establish my family. Get married. Have some kids. 

Right now my job is very stressful. It's a glorious job but sometimes it leaves me pondering my existence. Some nights I wake up at 4 am working, and no matter how much work I do, I never get done. 

I want to cut back and take a break. Maybe cut my pay to hire an assistant and say yes to fewer projects.

I also plan to sacrifice some speed in my work progress to focus on things like arts and finding love. 

But a lot of people call me stupid for wasting my potentials. I'm good at what I do and I will make a difference. It's just that I don't want to break down completely, and pushing myself too hard is never my lifestyle.
