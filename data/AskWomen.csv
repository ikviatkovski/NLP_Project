Come here to discuss your costumes, candies, parties, traditions, or minor acts of vandalism.

Enjoy the thread, everyone! Multiple submissions are encouraged. As are pictures of cats DOGS (and dogs cats I GUESS) dressed in their costumes. Hedgehogs, lizards and other pets in costume will also be squeed over.

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.
